## Project Structure Overview

In this project demo, we have implemented a simplified structure to accommodate the limited scope and time constraints. However, it's essential to acknowledge that a more complex architecture, such as the Hexagonal Architecture, can provide significant benefits in terms of maintainability, scalability, and flexibility.

### Hexagonal Architecture (Proposed)

To evolve the project into a more maintainable and scalable structure, we could adopt a Hexagonal Architecture. The proposed structure would look like this:

```
pilotes-order-management
|-- src
|   |-- main
|   |   |-- java
|   |   |   |-- com.example.pilotesordermanagement
|   |   |   |   |-- application
|   |   |   |   |   |-- controller
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- CustomerController.java
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- OrderController.java
|   |   |   |   |   |-- service
|   |   |   |   |       |-- CustomerService.java
|   |   |   |   |       |-- OrderService.java
|   |   |   |   |-- domain
|   |   |   |   |   |-- model
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- Customer.java
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- Order.java
|   |   |   |   |   |-- repository
|   |   |   |   |       |-- CustomerRepository.java
|   |   |   |   |       |-- OrderRepository.java
|   |   |   |   |-- infrastructure
|   |   |   |   |   |-- dto
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- CustomerDto.java
|   |   |   |   |   |   |-- OrderDto.java
|   |   |   |   |   |-- persistence
|   |   |   |   |       |-- entity
|   |   |   |   |       |   |-- CustomerEntity.java
|   |   |   |   |       |   |-- OrderEntity.java
|   |   |   |   |       |-- repository
|   |   |   |   |           |-- CustomerRepositoryImpl.java
|   |   |   |   |           |-- OrderRepositoryImpl.java
|   |   |-- resources
|   |       |-- application.properties
|-- pom.xml
```

### Benefits and Drawbacks
Adopting a more complex architecture like Hexagonal Architecture has several benefits:

- Clear separation of concerns: By segregating components into application, domain, and infrastructure layers, the architecture helps maintain a clean separation of concerns, improving maintainability and understandability.

- Loosely coupled components: Components within the architecture are loosely coupled, which promotes better flexibility and makes it easier to refactor or replace parts of the system.

- Enhanced testability: A well-defined separation between the components allows for easier testing, as each component can be tested in isolation.

- Scalability: The modular structure of the Hexagonal Architecture allows the application to scale more efficiently, as new components can be added with minimal impact on the existing codebase.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider when adopting a more complex architecture:

- Increased complexity: Introducing additional layers and components can increase the overall complexity of the system, making it harder for newcomers to understand and navigate the project.

- Longer initial setup time: Establishing a Hexagonal Architecture requires more initial setup and planning, which might slow down the development process in the early stages.

- Potential over-engineering: In some cases, a complex architecture might be overkill for a small project with limited scope and requirements. It's essential to assess the specific needs of the project before committing to a complex architectural pattern.

In conclusion, it's crucial to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of adopting a more complex architecture like Hexagonal Architecture. For this project demo, we opted for a simplified structure to accommodate the limited scope and time constraints. However, as the project grows and evolves, it could benefit from adopting a more robust architectural pattern.
